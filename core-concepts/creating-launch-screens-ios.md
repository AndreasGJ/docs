# Creating AppIcons and Launch Screens for iOS 

Publishing your iOS app is an essential step in the development process and in order for your iOS Application 
to be published successfully in App Store, there are some requirements that need to be fulfilled. 
As described in [iOS Human Interface Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/MobileHIG/IconMatrix.html) setting the following is mandatory::

* App name
* App Icon
* Launch image or files

In NativeScript your application comes with pre-defined template settings and images for this steps.
In this article, we are going to introduce the workflow to create your own launch screens..

## Setting Launch Screen and AppIcons

Setting up launch screens depends on the version of iOS you are targeting.
In iOS7 and lower the approach for creating launch screen is to use static image resources.
The drawback of this method is that the app developer will have to provide many different
images each with a different resolution for each iOS device. From iOS8 and above the approach is to create
a LaunchScreen.storyboard which is much more powerful in means of customization and is easier to maintain.

The default Hello-World project in NativeScript is provided with default settings that support both 
approaches. When building on devices with iOS lower than version 8 it will use the static images 
and when building on the device with iOS 8 and above it will use the provided LaunchScreen.storyboard..

### How to set your Launch Screen

The default template in NativeSccript (created with `tns create myApp`) is providing you with predefined 
AppIcons, Launch Images, LaunchScreen.storyboard all with the NativeScript logo. 
To modify it and create your own launch screen using your own assets and design you will need the following:

* **app/App_Resources/iOS/Assets.xcassets** - resource that holds your image asset catalogs (for AppIcons, LaunchImages and LaunchScreen)

* **app/App_Resources/iOS/LaunchScreen.storyboard** - your default storyboard used for your launch screen (used in iOS versions 8, 9 and 10)

* **app/App_Resources/iOS/build.xcconfig** - resource that holds the references to the assets catalogs which will be used 
(optional: modify only if you change the name convention or introduce new image asset catalog)

* Xcode 7.1 or newer version (optional: needed only if you prefer WYSIWIG workflow for changing your images)

The workflow for creating your own Launch Screen can be handled from Xcode or 'manually' in the NativeScript enviroment. 
In this article we are going to cover both the manual and the Xcode WYSIWYG approach.

In your **app/App_Resources/iOS/Assets.xcassets** you will find the following sub-folders
   
* **AppIcon.appiconset** - resource that holds the images for your AppIcons (all iOS versions)

* **LaunchImage.launchimage** - resource that holds the images for your Launch Screen images (for iOS 7 and lower versions)

* **LaunchScreen.AspectFill.imageset** - resource that holds the background image for your LaunchScreen.storyboard (for iOS 8, 9 amd 10)

* **LaunchScreen.Center.imageset** - resource that holds the centered image for your LaunchScreen.storyboard (for iOS 8, 9 amd 10)

### Customizing AppIcons
+ Changing AppIcons - Manual approach 
	
Open **AppIcon.appiconset**  and change the default icons images with your own using the proper resolution for each image (e.g. icon-29.png should be29px x 29px; icon-29@2x should be 58px x 58px)
If your images have different file names then open Contents.json and change the key `filename` for each image.

![App icons config.json](../img/launch-screen/ios/launch-screen-howto-002.png "App icons config.json")

+ Changing AppIcons - Xcode WYSIWYG approach
	
Drag and drop your **Assets.xcassets** into Xcode (7.1 or newer version).
In the opened window choose **AppIcon** and add proper image for each iOS version and device.
Close Xcode and rebuild your NativeScript app to use the new AppIcons.

### Customizing Launch Images
+ Manual approach 
	
Open **LaunchImage.launchimage** and change the default launch images with your own using the proper resolution for each image (e.g. Default-568h@2x.png should be 640px x 1136px).
If your images have different file names then open Contents.json and change the key `filename` for each image.

| Image Resolution | Image name                          |
|------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 320x480          | Default.png                         |
| 640x960          | Default@2x.png                      |
| 640x1136         | Default-568h@2x.png                 |
| 750x1334         | Default-667h@2x.png                 |
| 1242x2208        | Default-736h@3x.png                 |
| 768x1024         | Default-Portrait.png                |
| 1024x768         | Default-Landscape.png               |
| 1536x2048        | Default-Portrait@2x.png             |
| 2048x1536        | Default-Landscape@2x.png            |

> **Note: ** For better understanding of the supported image resolutions for the different iOS devices refer to [iOS Human Interface Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/MobileHIG/IconMatrix.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40006556-CH27-SW1)
or check our reference table 

+ Xcode WYSIWYG approach
	
Drag and drop your **Assets.xcassets** into Xcode (7.1 or newer version).
In the opened window choose **LaunchImage** and add proper image for each iOS version and device.
Close Xcode and rebuild your NativeScript app to use the new Launch Images.

> **Important:** Make sure you have provided all required images or your app wil be rejected from publishing in AppStore.	 


### Customizing LaunchScreen.storyboard

The default template app in NativeScript comes with LaunchScreen.storyboard which contains two Image Views.
The first one named LaunchScreen.AspectFill.imageset is used to visualize our background.
The second one named LaunchScreen.Center.imageset is used to visualize our centered logo.
Your own storyboard can be customized to use own logic wit different images and styles.
However keep in mind that according to iOS Human Interface Guidelines the LaunchScreen should be as light as possible
with minimum or none moving elements and text labels.It is meant to provide immediate UX rather than artistic presentation..

#### Customizing LaunchScreen.AspectFill

+ Manual approach 
	
Open **LaunchScreen.AspectFill.imageset** and change the default LaunchScreen.AspectFill images with your own using the proper scale for each image (1x, 2x and 3x).
As this is an image that will be used in your LaunchScreen.storyboard your actual resolution may vary depending on your design.
The default NativeScript template ships a LaunchScreen-AspectFill.png and LaunchScreen-AspectFill@2x.png used as a sample background.
If your images have different file names then open Contents.json and change the key `filename` for each image.

> **Important:** After each file change in the **Assets.xcassets** folder you should re-build your project and restart your emulator to avoid visualizing cached images.

+ Xcode WYSIWYG approach
	
Drag and drop your **Assets.xcassets** into Xcode (7.1 or newer version).
In the opened window choose **LaunchScreen.AspectFill** and add the properly scaled image for each entry (1x, 2x and 3x).
Close Xcode and rebuild your NativeScript app to use the new LaunchScreen.AspectFill.

#### Customizing LaunchScreen.Center

+ Manual approach 

Open **LaunchScreen.Center.imageset** and change the default LaunchScreen.Center images with your own using the proper scale for each image (1x, 2x and 3x).
As this is an image that will be used in your LaunchScreen.storyboard your actual resolution may vary depending on your design.
The default NativeScript template ships a LaunchScreen-Center.png and LaunchScreen-Center@2x.png used as a sample center logo image.
If your images have different file names then open Contents.json and change the key `filename` for each image.

> **Important:** After each file change in the **Assets.xcassets** folder you should re-build your project and restart your emulator to avoid visualizing cached images.

+ Xcode WYSIWYG approach

Drag and drop your **Assets.xcassets** into Xcode (7.1 or newer version).
In the opened window choose **LaunchScreen.Center** and add the properly scaled image for each entry (1x, 2x and 3x).
Close Xcode and rebuild your NativeScript app to use the new LaunchScreen.Center.
